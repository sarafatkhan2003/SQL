    "# 🧩 SESSION 7: GROUP BY & HAVING (Core Analytics SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 **Goal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand **why GROUP BY exists**\n",
    "* Learn how to **summarize data by categories**\n",
    "* Use **HAVING** correctly (big interview trap)\n",
    "* Answer **real business questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📌 80% of analytics SQL queries =\n",
    "> `GROUP BY + aggregate functions`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " **🔹 Why GROUP BY Exists (From Scratch)**\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, aggregates gave **one number for the whole table**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But businesses ask questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Average salary **per department**\n",
    "* Total employees **per city**\n",
    "* Highest salary **per team**\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 This means:\n",
    "**“Group rows first, then aggregate.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s exactly what `GROUP BY` does.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " **🔹 Mental Model (VERY IMPORTANT)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think in **two steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ Group similar rows\n",
    "2️⃣ Apply aggregate to each group\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 GROUP BY changes **how aggregation works**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " **🔹 Data We Are Using (Reminder)**\n",
    "\n",
    "`employees` table:\n",

    " **1️⃣ Basic GROUP BY Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    " **🔹 Syntax Pattern (Memorize)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT group_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column)\n",
    "FROM table\n",
    "GROUP BY group_column;\n",
    "```\n",

    "GROUP BY department;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " **What SQL Does:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FROM → employees\n",
    "2. GROUP BY → department\n",
    "3. AVG → salary per department\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "| department | avg   |\n",
    "| ---------- | ----- |\n",
