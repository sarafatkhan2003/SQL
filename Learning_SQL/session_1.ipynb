    "## 🔰 Why This Session Is CRITICAL\n",
    "\n",
    "Most beginners fail SQL because they:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memorize queries ❌\n",
    "* Don’t understand **what a database actually is** ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "This session fixes that.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of Session 1, you will:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Simple Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A **database** is a **structured place to store data** so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is safe\n",
    "* It is fast to search\n",
    "* Many people can use it at the same time\n",
