    "### 🔹 Definition (Simple, Interview-Safe)\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Store data\n",
    "* Retrieve data\n",
    "* Modify data\n",
    "* Delete data\n",
    "  from a **database**\n",

    "### 🔹 Think of SQL Like This\n",
    "\n",
    "* Excel → You manually scroll & filter\n",
    "* SQL → You **ask questions** and get answers instantly\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (don’t worry about syntax yet):\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Give me all employees earning more than 50,000 from IT department.”\n",

    "That question → SQL query.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, etc.)\n",
    "* NOT Excel\n",
    "* NOT CSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Your job as an analyst:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use SQL to **pull data**\n",
    "2. Use Python/Excel to **analyze**\n",
    "3. Use charts to **explain**\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* How many customers do we have?\n",
    "* What is total sales last month?\n",
    "* Which city has highest revenue?\n",
    "* Who are the top 10 customers?\n",
    "* Which products are loss-making?\n",

    "❌ SQL is NOT programming like Python\n",
    "❌ SQL does NOT use loops like `for`\n",
    "❌ SQL does NOT create ML models\n",

    "## 7️⃣ Analyst Mindset (CRITICAL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing any SQL, always ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What table has my data?\n",
    "2. What columns do I need?\n",
    "3. What condition filters rows?\n",
    "4. What final output is expected?\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Why do companies prefer SQL databases over Excel?\n",
    "2. Where does SQL fit in the data analytics workflow?\n",
    "3. Can SQL replace Python? Why or why not?\n",
    "4. What kind of questions does SQL answer best?\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 If you can explain this **out loud**, you are learning correctly.\n",
